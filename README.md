# frontend-regular-boilerplate

## What's ready by this boilerplate?

All `.pug`, `.styl` and ES2017 files under `src/` will be compiled to `build/`.
Assets in `src/assets/` will be copied to `build/assets/`, keeping its structure.

These files are watched and on livereload, of course!

## What's inside?

 - Pug
 - Stylus
 - Babel with Webpack
 - ESLint with StandardJS-style coding rules
 - Minifiers for HTML/CSS/JS

...etc!

## Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/fj68/frontend-regular-boilerplate.git
$ cd frontend-regular-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Customization

All configurations are written in `gulpfile.babel.js`.
